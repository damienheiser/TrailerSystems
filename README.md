Schematics and Code supporting my Burning Man Trailer Systems
I'll be sharing any code or schematics of things I create to support the trailer I'll be living in for a month in the desert.

# LogicalAudioSelector.fzz
This schematic was designed to allow me to use the built in Radio, an Auxiliary, and a Rapberry Pi audio input.  Switch 1 controls Network (Edgerouter, Unifi, Raspberry Pi with Airplay).  Switch 2 controls Audio Source.  UP ON is RPI/Aux (RPI if Internet is On, Aux if Internet is Off), CENTER OFF is Radio, DOWN ON is Aux.  12v Trigger to amplifier is controlled via relays on source selector and radio ground.
